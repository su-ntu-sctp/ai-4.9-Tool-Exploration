# Assignment (Optional)

## Brief

Analyze and compare different CI/CD tools to make informed decisions about tool selection for various scenarios.

1. **CI/CD Tool Comparison Analysis**
   - Create a comparison table for the four CI/CD tools covered in the lesson: CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps
   - For each tool, document the following characteristics:
     - **Type:** Cloud-based, self-hosted, or hybrid
     - **Setup difficulty:** Easy, medium, or hard
     - **Configuration language:** YAML, Groovy, or other
     - **Free tier:** Describe what's included
     - **Best use cases:** List 2-3 scenarios where this tool excels
     - **Main limitations:** List 2-3 drawbacks or constraints
   - Create a visual table or chart comparing these tools
   - Example format:
```
     | Feature | CircleCI | GitLab CI/CD | Jenkins | Azure DevOps |
     |---------|----------|--------------|---------|--------------|
     | Type    | Cloud SaaS | Cloud/Self-hosted | Self-hosted | Cloud SaaS |
     | Setup   | Easy | Easy | Hard | Medium |
     | ...     | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

2. **Tool Selection Scenarios**
